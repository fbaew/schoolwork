Schoolwork
==========
This repo is a small selection of old course work from my time in the
Bachelor of Computer Science program at the University of Calgary
from 2008-2012

This code is provided as-is, just in case anyone else finds it interesting.
Please forgive any flagrant sins, I was a starry-eyed undergraduate!

Crypto
------
Upper-level undergraduate course in Cryptography. This course focused
heavily on the mathematics underlying modern cryptography, particularly
public key crypto. Among other things, we had to implement RSA encryption
(Hopefully the only time I'll ever "roll my own")

Compilers
---------
In addition to a formidible serving of theoretical content, over the course
of the term, we were responsible for implementing a compiler for a toy language
("Minisculus"), targeting a toy stack machine.

MovieExplore
------------
This was a semester-long project I produced with fellow student Kyle Millz for a
Software Engineering course. I have included it here as one of the main focuses
in that course was learning to write test cases. Take a look at movieexplore/README
for build instructions and information about running the tests.

MovieExplore is a frontend for the MovieLens dataset, allowing you to search for
movies and to browse automatically-generated recoommendations.
