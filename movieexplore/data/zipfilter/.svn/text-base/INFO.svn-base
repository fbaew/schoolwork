Basically we've got 5 movies rated really well, and 5 more rated less well. All the "good"
movies have a rating of 5 (score of 25, that is, five people have rated them.) All of
these top rated movies were rated by people from Sauquoit, NY (zip = 13456). The "less
good" five movies were rated by people from none other than Beverly Hills 90210. They
are much more discerning in their taste of movies, so the scores are lower. As a result,
we expect to see none of the "best" five if we restrict our search to 90210.

To Summarize:

Movies 1-6 are rated 5 by the people of Sauquoit
Movies 7-11 are rated 4 by the people of Beverly Hills
Movie 12 is the least popular of them all, with one rating of 1 from Beverly Hills, and
one rating of 1 from Sauquoit.

(I also mean to imply that the total score (see popularity.pdf) is higher for Sauquoit
than for Beverly Hills.)

We expect to see movies 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 when we do top --zip=90210, and we never expect
to see movie 12.

I've also added some movies which are all rated below movies 1-5, but whose ratings come
from users in zip code 90277 (Redondo Beach). doing top --zip=902 should count their results
as well as the Beverly Hills ones.
