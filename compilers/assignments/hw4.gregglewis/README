Usage:

As usual, you can pipe the source file into the parser script, and be presented
with an intermediate representation tree corresponding to that source.

For example:

	cat tests/M/4.m | python TypeChecker.py

8 test files have been lovingly handcrafted by yours truly, and placed with
care in tests/M/

Error messages are logged to stderr, while the IR is displayed on stdout.
