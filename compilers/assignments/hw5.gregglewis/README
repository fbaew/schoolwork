CPSC 411 Assignment 5

Usage:

As usual, you can pipe the source file into the compiler script, and be presented
with some AM code that corresponds to your M source (which you can subsequently
pipe to another file!)

For example:

	cat tests/as5/05.m | python Compiler.py > compiled.am

5 test files have been lovingly handcrafted by yours truly, and placed with
care in tests/as5/

Additional tests can be found in tests/ and tests/M/

Error messages are logged to stderr, while the AM code is displayed on stdout.


I realized my submission for AS4 was using some syntax which was incompatible with Python 2.4
(Just for exception handling, nothing major. Hope I didn't get owned too hard for that!)
