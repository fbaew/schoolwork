/*
    This is a pretty useless program, but it uses a lot of the possible
    derivations within the m- language.
    
    It will prompt the user for a value. If the value is anything other than
    the number 0, it will enter an infinite loop, printing "604" over and over.
    
    If the first number entered is 0, then the user will be prompted for a
    second value, which will be doubled and displayed.
