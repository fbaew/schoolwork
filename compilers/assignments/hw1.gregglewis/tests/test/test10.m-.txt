/*  An implementation of monus (truncated subtraction)  */

begin
   read x;
   read y;
   do begin
     test := x*y;  % zero if either x or y are zero
     if test then begin  
                    x:= x-1;
                    y:= y-1;
                  end;
     else begin end;
     if test then nottest:= 0 else nottest=1;
   until nottest;
   print x;
end

% or is it? Can you detect all the errors and correct the program?
